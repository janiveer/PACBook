		==================
		Profile parameters
		==================
		If the root element has a condition attribute, we profile the document by
		condition using the value provided. Otherwise, we profile the document by
		condition using the root document's xml:id attribute. Conditional text in
		transcluded documents can thus be included / ignored based on the xml:id
		(or condition attribute) of the including document.
